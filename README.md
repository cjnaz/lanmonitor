# lanmonitor - Keeping watch on the health of your network resources

lanmonitor keeps tabs on key resources in your LAN environment (not actually limited to your LAN).  A text message notification (and/or email) is sent for any monitored _item_ that's out of sorts (not running, not responding, too old, ...).  Periodic re-notifications are sent for
critical items, such as firewalld being down, and summary reports are generated up to daily.

- lanmonitor uses a plug-in architecture, and is easily extensible for new items to monitor and new reporting/notification needs.
- A configuration file is used for all setups - no coding required for use.  The config file may be modified on-th-fly while lanmonitor is running as a service.
- Checks may be executed from the local machine, or from any remote host (with ssh access).  For example, you can check the health of a service running on another machine, or check that a webpage is accessible from another machine.

## Setup and Usage notes
- Install lanmonitor from PyPI (`pip install lanmonitor`).
- Install the initial configuration files (`lanmonitor --setup-user` places files at `~/.config/lanmonitor`).

- Edit `lanmonitor.cfg` for the **Core tool parameters**:
  - `ServiceLoopTime` sets how long between rechecks in service mode.  Set to a fraction (eg: 25%) of the shortest item check_interval.
  - `nRetries` sets how many tries will be made to accomplish each monitored item.
  - `RetryInterval` sets the time between nRetries.
  - `StartupDelay` is a wait time (default 0 seconds) when starting in `--service mode` to allow everything to come up fully (or crash) at system boot before checking starts.
  - `DailyRuntime` is the run time for monitored items that run at daily or longer check intervals (optional).  This setting allows for controlling what time-of-day the infrequent checks are run.  Set this to a few minutes before the `SummaryTime` so that summaries are current.  Generally, don't tag daily+ items as `critical` since this will cause critical renotifications but with infrequent rechecks to clear the item.  If not defined, daily+ items are checked at the time-of-day that lanmonitor was started.
  - `Gateway` is any reliable host on your LAN (typically your router) that will be checked for access as a gate for any monitor items to be run from/on/via other hosts.  For example, the above `Process_tempmon` item will only run if the `Gateway` host can be accessed.  `Gateway` is optional - if not defined then remote-based checks are always run.
  - `LogLevel` controls what gets written to the log file.  At LogLevel 30 (the default if not specified), only warning/fail/critical events are logged.  LogLevel 20 logs passing events also.  For interactive use (non --service mode) the command line --verbose switch controls loglevel.
  - `LogFile` specifies the log file in --service mode.  The path may be absolute or relative to the script's directory.  Interactive usage (non --service mode) logging goes to the console.
  - `PrintLogLength`, `ConsoleLogFormat`, and `FileLogFormat` may also be customized.

- Edit `lanmonitor.cfg` for the **Notification handler parameters**:
  - `Notif_handlers` is a whitespace separated list of Python modules (without the .py extension) that will handle monitored item event tracking, notifications, and periodic summaries. `stock_notify.py` is provided, and has full functionality.  See [Writing Notification Handler Plugins](#writing-notification-handler-plugins), below. An optional absolute or relative (to the lanmonitor modules directory) path may be specified for each notification handler, eg:
  
            Notif_handlers  stock_notif  ~/my_lanmon_dir/my_notif_plugin
    
  - `CriticalReNotificationInterval` sets how long between repeated notifications for any failing CRITICAL monitored items in service mode.  Set `ServiceLoopTime` less than `CriticalReNotificationInterval` so that resolved critical items are rechecked before the next renotification message.  (As implemented by the `stock_notif.py` notification handler.)
  - `SummaryDays` sets which days of the week for summaries to be emailed.  Monday =1, Tuesday =2, ... Saturday =6, Sunday = 7.  Multiple days may be selected.  Comment out `SummaryDays` to eliminate summaries.  (As implemented by the `stock_notif.py` notification handler.)
  - `SummaryTime` sets the time of day (local time) for summaries to be emailed.  24-clock format, for example, `13:00`.  (As implemented by the `stock_notif.py` notification handler.)
  - `LogSummary`, if True, forces the content of the periodic summary to also be sent to the log file.  (As implemented by the `stock_notif.py` notification handler.)
  - `EmailTo` is a whitespace separated list of email addresses that summaries will be sent to.  Comment out EmailTo to disable emailing summaries.  (As implemented by the `stock_notif.py` notification handler.)
  - `NotifList` is a whitespace separated list of phone numbers (using your carrier's email-to-text bridge) to which event notifications will be sent.  Comment out NotifList to disable all notifications.  (As implemented by the `stock_notif.py` notification handler.)

- Edit `lanmonitor.cfg`  and `creds_SMTP` for the **SMTP email parameters**.
  - Enter `NotifList`, and `EmailTo` addresses, and import your email credentials file (`import creds_SMTP`). Any, none, or all parameters may be moved to an imported config file.
  
            EmailServer       mail.mailserver.com
            EmailServerPort   P587TLS                 # One of: P465, P587, P587TLS, or P25   
            EmailUser	      yourusername@mailserver.com
            EmailPass	      yourpassword
            EmailFrom         yourfromaddress@mailserver.com

- See [below](#monitored-items-setup) for setting up items to be monitored.
- Run the tool with `lanmonitor --verbose`.  Make sure that the local machine and user (root?) has password-less ssh access to any remote machines.  `-v` enables INFO level logging of passing itmes.  `-vv` turns on DEGUG level logging.
- Install lanmonitor as a systemd service (google how).  An example `lanmonitor.service` file is provided in the config directory.  Note that the config file may be modified while the service is running, with changes taking effect on the next ServiceLoopTime.  Make sure that the user that the service runs under (typically root) has ssh password-less access to any remotes.
- stock_notif sends a text message for each monitored item that is in a FAIL or CRITICAL state.  CRITICAL items have a repeated text message sent after the `CriticalReNotificationInterval`.  Notifications are typically sent as text messages, but may be (also) directed to regular email addresses.
- stock_notif also sends a periodic summary report listing any current warnings/fails/criticals, or that all is well.  Summaries are typically sent as email messages.
- NOTE:  All timevalues in the config file may be entered with a `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d` (days), or `w` (weeks) suffix.  For example `6h` is 6 hours.  If no suffix is provided the time value is taken as seconds.
- NOTE:  You may wish to set static leases for hosts that you will be accessing by name, otherwise you may get HOST \<xxx> IS NOT KNOWN warnings until that host renews its IP address after a router (DHCP / DNS resolver) reboot.
- Supported on Python3.6+ on Linux.

## Monitored items setup
Items to be monitored are defined in the `lanmonitor.cfg` file.  "Plugin" modules provide the logic for each monitored item type.  [Supplied plugins](#supplied-plugins) are described below.  See the description at the top of each plugin module for additional notes.
To activate a given plugin, a `MonType_` line is included in the configuration file using this format:

      MonType_<type>    <plugin_name>

1. Begins with the `MonType_` prefix
2. The `<type>` is used as the prefix on successive lines for monitor items of this type
3. The `<plugin_name>` is the Python module name (implied .py suffix). An optional absolute or relative (to the lanmonitor modules directory) path may specified, eg: `MonType_XYZ ~/my_lanmon_dir/myXYZ_plugin`.

For monitored items, the general format of a line is

      <type>_<friendly_name>  <local or user@host[:port]>  [CRITICAL]  <check_interval>  <rest_of_line>

1. `<type>` matches the corresponding `MonType_<type>` line.
2. `<friendly_name>` is arbitrary and is used for notifications, logging, etc. `<type>_<friendly_name>` must be unique.
3. `<local or user@host[:port]>` specifies _on which machine the check will be executed from._  If not "`local`" then `user@host` specifies the ssh login on the remote machine.  For example, the `Host_Yahoo` line below specifies that `Yahoo.com` will be pinged from the `RPi2.mylan` host by doing an `ssh me@RPi2.mylan ping Yahoo.com`.  The default ssh port is 22, but may be specified via the optional `:port` field.
4. `CRITICAL` may optionally be specified.  CRITICAL tagged items are those that need immediate attention.  Renotifications are sent for these items when failing by the `stock_notif.py` notification handler based on the `CriticalReNotificationInterval` config parameter.  (For critical-tagged items their `check_interval` should be less than the `CriticalReNotificationInterval`.)
5. `<check_interval>` is the wait time between rechecks for this specific item.  Each item is checked at its own check_interval.
5. `<rest_of_line>` are the monitored type-specific settings.

## Writing Monitor Plugins

New plugins may be added easily.  The core lanmonitor code provides a framework for configuration, logging, command retries, and parsing components.  The general process for creating a new plugin is:

- Copy an existing plugin, such as the `lanmonitor/src/lanmonitor/webpage_plug.py` to a working directory as `mynewitem_plugin.py`.
- Adjust the \<newitem> comment block to describe the functionality and config file details.
- Within the `setup()` function:
  - Adjust the `rest_of_line` parsing, creating new vars as needed.
  - Add any checker code to validate these new values.
- Within the `eval_status()` function:
  - Adjust the `cmd` for your needed subprocess call command.
  - The `cmd_check()` function can check the returncode or return text.  It also returns the full subprocess call response.  _See the cmd_check function within the lanmonfuncs.py module for built-in checking features._  Uncomment the `# logging.debug (f"cmd_check response:  {rslt}")` line to see what's available for building response checker code.
  - Adjust the `if rslt[0] == True: … return` lines for the PASS, FAIL/CRITICAL return text.  The `key_padded` and `host_padded` vars are used on the PASSing line for pretty printing.
- Create a companion `mynewitem_plugin_test.py` by copying from the lanmonitor/tests directory, and create `dotest()` calls to exercise all possible good, bad, and invalid conditions.
- Debug and validate the new plugin module by running standalone (`./mynewitem_plugin_test.py`).
- Add the `MonType_<your_monitor_type> <abs_path_to>/mynewitem_plugin>` line and specific monitor items to your config file.
  - New plugins are welcome for bundling into the lanmonitor distribution.  Open a github issue.

<br/>

### Additional plugin writing notes
1. The `setup()` function of your module will be called for each related `<type>_<friendly_name>` line in the config file.  setup() is called only once at initial startup and after any on-the-fly edits to the configuration file.  setup() is supplied a dictionary:

        Monitor item dictionary keys passed to setup():
            key             Full 'itemtype_tag' key value from config file line
            tag             'tag' portion only from 'itemtype_tag' from config file line
            user_host_port  'local' or 'user@hostname[:port]' from config file line
            host            'local' or 'hostname' from config file line
            critical        True if 'CRITICAL' is in the config file line
            check_interval  Time in seconds between rechecks
            rest_of_line    Remainder of line (plugin specific formatting)

    - setup() must return RTN_PASS, RTN_WARNING, or RTN_FAIL.  If RTN_FAIL the setup failure is permanent and the item will not be monitored (but setup() will be retried again after a config file edit).  If RTN_WARNING the setup will be retried on the next checking iteration, thus allowing for intermittent issues during setup.  Warnings and Fails are logged.
    - Within setup(), commands may optionally be executed on the target machine for determining setup specifics (see `service_plugin.py` for an example).  NOTE that `check_LAN_access` (see next section) is NOT called before the setup() calls, so setup() failures might be due to no network access, or due to ssh access issues to the target machine.

2. The `eval_status()` function is called on each checking iteration.  The plugin needs to return a dictionary with 3 keys:

        eval_status() returns dictionary with these keys:
            rslt            Integer status:  RTN_PASS, RTN_WARNING, RTN_FAIL, RTN_CRITICAL
            notif_key       Unique handle for tracking active notifications in the notification handler 
            message         String with status and context details

      - `cmd_check()` in `lanmonfuncs.py` provides checking features such as command execution with retries, ssh for remote hosts, and check strings in the command response.  The raw command output is also returned so that your code can construct specific checks. Uncomment the `logging.debug()` call after the cmd_check() call and run with debugging logging (`lanmonitor -vv`, or run the plugin standalone)
      to see the available cmd_check() response data. See `lanmonfuncs.py` for cmd_check feature details and the return structure.
      - If the host is not `local` then the lanmonitor core will check that the local machine has access to the LAN by pinging the the `Gateway` host defined in the config file.  This `check_LAN_access()` check is performed only once per check iteration.  Thus, your eval_status() code can assume that the LAN is accessible.  It is recommended that you include a `Host_<myhost>` check (using the pinghost plugin) earlier in the config file to limit fail ambiguity.

3. The plugin module may be tested by running the companion `..._test.py` script.  Add tests to exercise your checking logic for both local and remote hosts, and for any warning/error traps.  (Note that the checking interval scheduling is handled in the lanmonitor core, so in the `dotest()` calls just set `"check_interval":1` as a placeholder.)

            dotest ({"key":"SELinux_local", "tag":"local", "host":"local", "user_host_port":"local", "critical":True, "check_interval":1, "rest_of_line":"enforcing"})

            dotest ({"key":"SELinux_RPiX", "tag":"RPiX", "host":"RPiX", "user_host_port":"pi@rpiX", "critical":True, "check_interval":1, "rest_of_line":"enforcing"})

            dotest ({"key":"SELinux_RPi2", "tag":"RPi2", "host":"rpi2.lan", "user_host_port":"pi@rpi2.lan", "critical":False, "check_interval":1, "rest_of_line":"enforcing"})

            dotest ({"key":"SELinux_badmode", "tag":"Shop2", "host":"local", "user_host_port":"local", "critical":True, "check_interval":1, "rest_of_line":"enforcingX"})

            dotest ({"key":"SELinux_RPi2_CRIT", "tag":"RPi2_CRIT", "host":"rpi2.lan", "user_host_port":"pi@rpi2.lan", "critical":True, "check_interval":1, "rest_of_line":"enforcing"})

## Writing Notification Handler Plugins

One or more notification handlers may be specified in the configuration file line, such as:

      Notif_handlers		stock_notif   my_notif	# Whitespace separated list of notification handlers

The following functions within each listed notification handler are called.  The functionality as provided by `stock_notif` is describe here.  NOTE that the stock_notif handler module need not be used.

- `log_event()` - Called after every monitored item, passing the dictionary returned by eval_status() (see above) onto log_event().  The stock_notif handler sends notifications on new FAIL and CRITICAL items, and clears any fail history of now-passing items.
- `each_loop()` - Called on every lanmonitor core _service loop_ (per ServiceLoopTime).  Place any general code here that needs to be executed on every iteration.  Unused by stock_notif.
- `renotif()` - Called on every lanmonitor core _service loop_ (per ServiceLoopTime).  Place any code here related to sending additional notifications for items that remain broken.  stock_notif sends repeat notification messages for any critical items on every `CriticalReNotificationInterval` period.  All still-broken critical items are bundled into a single message so as to minimize text messages being sent.
- `summary()` - Called on every lanmonitor core _service loop_ (per ServiceLoopTime).  Place any code here related to scheduling and producing a periodic report.  The lanmonfuncs.py module provides `next_summary_timestring()`, which uses `SummaryTime` and `SummaryDays` in the config file, for summary scheduling.  stock_notif's summary simply emails a list of any current WARNING, FAIL, or CRITICAL items, or an "All is well" message to provide a periodic _lanmonitor-is-alive_ message.

## Debug features:
- lanmonitor dynamically reloads the config file when it senses that the config file has been changed.  When reloaded, all monitored items are reinitialized per the current content of the config file, and all prior monitored items and their history are discarded.  All setting may be changed, such as the core tool parameters, notification handler parameters, and setups on monitored items.
- Setting LogLevel to 10 in the config file enables debug level logging to the log file while running in service mode.
- Running interactively with `-vv` enables debug level logging to the console.  A summary report is also produced, which allows checking summary report operations and content.
- Sending a SIGUSR1 signal to lanmonitor when running in service mode causes a summary to be generated to the log file.
- Sending a SIGUSR2 signal to lanmonitor when running in service mode causes a dump of the current status of all monitored items, including prior runtime, next runtime, and any alert messages.  
- To send signals to a running lanmonitor service process use the `kill -<signal> <pid>` command (eg, `$ kill -SIGUSR1 7829`).  The process pid is printed in the startup banner to the log, or may be found using `ps`.
- Monitor item plugins have companion test case files.  Copy a plugin and its test file from the repo to a working directory, then run the test file (eg, `$ ./fsactivity_plugin_test.py`).
